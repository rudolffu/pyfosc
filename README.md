__Please note: This program is under active development. The documentation may be inconsistent with the latest codes.__

PyFOSC is a pipeline toolbox for long-slit spectroscopy data reduction written in Python. It can be used for FOSC (Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera) data from Xinglong/Lijiang 2-meter telescopes.  

BFOSC (Beijing-Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera) is an instrument of the 2.16-m Telescope in Xinglong Observatory, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) (IAU code: 327, coordinates: 40°23′39″ N, 117°34′30″ E). For more information about BFOSC, please see http://www.xinglong-naoc.org/html/en/gcyq/216/detail-18.html.

YFOSC (Yunnan-Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera) is an instrument of the 2.4-m Telescope in Lijiang Observatory, Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (YNAO) (IAU code: O44, coordinates: 26°42′33.1″ N, 100°1′51.6″ E). For more information about YFOSC, please see http://wiki.gmg.org.cn/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=557106.

## 1. Installation 


```sh
conda install -c astropy ccdproc photutils
```

### 1.1. Dependencies
```
IRAF
PyRAF
pandas
```
This package depends on [IRAF](http://iraf.noao.edu/) and [PyRAF](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyraf). Although these two softwares will no longer be supported by their developers, you can still download and install the [IRAF Community Distribution](https://iraf-community.github.io/).
### 1.2. Install the [IRAF/PyRAF Community Distribution](https://iraf-community.github.io/)

For detailed description on how to install IRAF and PyRAF, visit:
- https://iraf-community.github.io/install.html
- https://iraf-community.github.io/x11iraf.html
- https://iraf-community.github.io/pyraf.html

### 1.3. Download PyFOSC and set environment variable for it.

You can use `git clone` to download this package.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudolffu/pyfosc.git
```

To checkout the current branch (`py3dev`), use
```bash
git checkout py3dev
```
In order to run PyFOSC commands in the terminal, you need to add the path of PyFOSC and its sub-directory `src` to $PATH, by editing `~/.bashrc` (Linux, e.g., Ubuntu) or `~/.bash_profile` (Mac OS). An example of this can be:
```Bash
export PATH=/Your/Path/to/pyfosc:$PATH
export PATH=/Your/Path/to/pyfosc/src:$PATH
```

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Preparation

#### 2.1.1 Run `pyfosc_init` to begin

First go to the working directory which contains FOSC spectroscopic data.
Run `pyfosc_init` from the terminal:
```
pyfosc_init
```

#### 2.1.2 Generate lists of files

As PyFOSC pipeline reduce data grouped by different types (bias, flat, object, etc), make sure you have lists of fits files as follows:
```
zero.list --------------- List of bias files (e.g. bias*.fits).
flat.list --------------- List of flat field files (e.g. flat*.fits).
objall.list ------------- List of 2d spectra images of all objects (science targets and standard stars).
lampall.list ------------ List of all 2d lamp spectra images.
flatnall.list ----------- List of 2d images that need zero correction (flat.list + lampall.list + objall.list).
specall.list ------------ List of all 2d spectra images (objall.list + lampall.list).
```

### 2.2 Running the pipeline
You can run `pyfosc_run.sh` from the terminal:
```
pyfosc_run.sh
```
Alternatively, you can run the scripts step by step, following the order as:
```
makezero2m.py     # Combine zero(bias) frames.
ccdotz.py         # Do zero(bias), overscan correction and trimming.
makeflat2m.py     # Combine flat fields.
makereflat2m.py   # Do (illumination) normalization and get perfect flat.
divideflat2m.py   # Do flat correction.
removecr_ccdp.py  # Remove cosmic rays in two-d images. Please go to 3. Credits for more information.
doapall.py        # Extract spectra.
reidentlamp2m.py  # Reidentify lamp spectra with previously stored ones.
#Can use identlamp2m.py instead to identify lamp by oneself.
wavecal2m.py      # Do wavelength calibration, flux calibration.
telluric_base2m.py # Telluric correction and one-d spectra extraction.
```

Plot all final 1d spectra with:
```
plotonedsp.py
```

Move some intermediate files into `INTMD` directory:
```
mvintmd.sh
```
